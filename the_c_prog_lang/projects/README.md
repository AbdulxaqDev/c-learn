# Word and letter histogram application in C language

This application generates words and letters histogram in illustrative way.

It gives the number of words with the same length and number of a letter's repetition.

[see the code](https://github.com/AbdulxaqDev/c-learn/blob/main/the_c_prog_lang/projects/char_word_histogram.c)

## To run this application you need

C and C++ Compilers [gcc](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/what-is-a-compiler-in-c/) to run c code.

## Usage

It will promt you text input in terminal. You can past any text or you can type it in terminal.
As you can see, I run the application and it is waiting for text input:

I typed sample text:

![sample input text](./images/input_text.png)

I pressed <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>D</kbd> twice (if you are in Windows, press <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Z</kbd>).

And, here are the results:

![word histogram](./images/word_histogram.png)

This histogram is saying that the input text containes two words with the length of 5, a word with the length of 6 and so on.

Here explanation of histogram:

![histogram description](./images/histogram.png)

At the beginning, it is showing the leng of word in squar brackets [5], the bar length tells the most repeated one. At the end, the exact number of words with same length in sample text.

Here is the similar result for letters:

![letter histogram](./images/letter_histpgram.png)

Here we see can the letters repetition on above histogram. For example, "H" letter came once and "e" letter came four times in sample text.
